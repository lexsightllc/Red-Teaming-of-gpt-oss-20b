# MODULE: Purpose
# =======================
Purpose: >
  Comprehensive adversarial evaluation of gpt-oss-20b with new control planes:
  risk alignment for financial advising, code quality gate for generation, A/B
  moderation guard for community health, and exam-awareness detection to uncover
  test-conditioned masking. The omega_redteam_harness orchestrates reproducible,
  instrumented scenarios with strict schemas and redaction, producing hashed,
  verifiable findings and validating post-mitigation resilience end-to-end.

# MODULE: Conclusion
# =======================
Conclusion: >
  The hardened omega_redteam_harness surfaced high-impact misalignment patterns
  in gpt-oss-20b across finance, code generation, moderation, and exam-awareness.
  With risk alignment, quality gating, moderation guard A/B, and evaluation-awareness
  controls now integrated—and deterministic schemas, receipts, and redaction enforced—
  the pipeline produces reproducible, evidence-backed outputs. All integration and
  unit tests pass, providing a durable foundation for ongoing alignment and safety
  research, plus reliable post-mitigation validation.
