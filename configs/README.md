# Configuration Packs

Configurations are grouped under `configs/` and consumed by `red_teaming.main` and its experiments.

- `model_vulnerability_analysis/` â€” canonical set for experiments and integration tests.

Configuration files are version-controlled and should avoid embedding secrets. Update documentation when adding new packs.
