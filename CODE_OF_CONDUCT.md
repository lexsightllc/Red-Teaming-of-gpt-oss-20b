# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a harassment-free, inclusive, and collaborative community. All participants agree to:

- Treat others with respect and empathy.
- Act in good faith when discussing vulnerabilities or mitigation strategies.
- Provide constructive feedback and avoid personal attacks.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

## Reporting

Report unacceptable behaviour to `conduct@your-org.example`. Reports will be handled confidentially by the maintainers.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take appropriate corrective action, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from community spaces. Decisions will prioritise the safety of marginalized people first.

We adopt and adapt the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) to this project. Participation implies agreement to these standards.
